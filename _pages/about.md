MinPhase aims to be a blog for engineers by engineers, with practical posts that can be followed and then implemented. The blog is mostly directed at vehicular control since that is our area of expertize. We will also include tips and tricks for different software and might expand to other areas in the future. 

We want to create a community around the practical solutions to problems. The goal is let the authors share their ideas in a informal and practical manner where the implementation is the focus. Which will give the readers a repository of implemented solutions at their fingertips.



## History
MinPhase is started at the division of Vehicular Systems at Link√∂pings University by Viktor Leek and Dennis Edblom.
